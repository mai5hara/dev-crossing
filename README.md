# Dev Crossing

Web Crossing is a social networking web application for developers who want to connect with other developers in the same field as you or in the field you want to study. <br/>
There is a bulletin board where you can leave comments about coding/design issues that you currently have or technologies you are interested in or any other things. Also, you can search comments by category and check other developers' comments.
